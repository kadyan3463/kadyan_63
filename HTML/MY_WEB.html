            About Programming <br> Languages
        </h3>
        <p>
            A programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do. Examples are: Python,
            Ruby, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, and C#. Programming languages are used to write all computer programs and
            computer software. A programming language is like a set of instructions that the computer follows to do
            something.
            A programmer writes text in the source code of a programming language to make programs. Usually, the
            programming language uses real words for some of the commands (e.g. "if... then... else...", "and", "or"),
            so that the language is easier for a human to understand. Like any normal language, many programming
            languages use punctuation. Many programs are then compiled, which means that the computer changes, or
            translates, the source code into another language (such as assembly language[1][2] or machine language) that
            a computer can read, but which is much harder for a person to read.

        <p class="content"><br>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust,
            object-oriented and secure programming language.
            Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James
            Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered
            company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.
            Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java
            has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

        <p class="content"><br>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language
            for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of
            elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
            HTML tutorial or HTML 5 tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of HTML. Our HTML tutorial is
            developed for beginners and professionals. In our tutorial, every topic is given step-by-step so that you
            can learn it in a very easy way. If you are new in learning HTML, then you can learn HTML from basic to a
            professional level and after learning HTML with CSS and JavaScript you will be able to create your own
            interactive and dynamic website. But Now We will focus on HTML only in this tutorial.
